"""
Here are the constants that we need to start creating the Erasure Decoding Process.
They will consist of: The corrupted code word (which is inside the function), the H matrix, max iterations, and
an E matrix. The corrupted code is what we're trying to figure out, the H matrix is what does the solving, 
the max is for max attempts, and the E matrix is the matrix that will, for each keyword bit, have the opinion
of each check node. This means E must equal H in terms of size.
